 ### Expressions and operators
 ---------
 This is samll describes about JavaScript's expressions and operators, including assignment, comparison, arithmetic, bitwise, logical.

 Assignment operators.

An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x.

Return value and chaining.

Like most expressions, assignments like x = y have a return value. It can be retrieved by e.g. assigning the expression or logging it.

Comparison operators.

A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true.

loops.

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This chapter of the JavaScript Guide introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript.

You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another.
