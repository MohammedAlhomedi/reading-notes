### Control flow
-------
The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. 

The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function , this happened When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button),When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code and Automatically (self invoked)
