### Markdown Language ### 
------
Markdown is markup language for creating formatted text using a plain text editor.Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.

The idea behind Markdown is that plain text documents should be readable without tags mussing everything up, but there should still be ways to add text modifiers like lists, bold, italics, etc. 

It is an alternative to what you see is what you get, which use rich text that later gets converted to proper HTML.
